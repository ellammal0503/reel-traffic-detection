# Problem Statement

Social Networking Services (SNS) like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube transmit both:
- **Video traffic (reels, shorts, live streams)**  
- **Non-video traffic (feeds, suggestions, chat, ads)**  

Since both traverse the same data pipeline, distinguishing them in **real-time** is crucial to:
- Optimize performance on User Equipment (UE).
- Improve Quality of Experience (QoE).
- Enable adaptive scheduling under varying congestion/coverage.

This project develops an **AI-based classifier** that can detect whether traffic is **reel/video** or **non-reel** using only **network metadata**.
