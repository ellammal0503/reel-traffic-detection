# ðŸ”® Future Work

## 1. Advanced Model Architectures
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Model relationships between packets and flows instead of treating them as flat sequences.  
- **Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT for traffic):** Leverage self-attention to capture long-term dependencies in video vs. non-video traffic.  
- **Multimodal Learning:** Combine packet-level features with metadata (timing, app signals, QoE metrics).  

---

## 2. Expanded Dataset Coverage
- Collect larger-scale **multi-application datasets** (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat).  
- Incorporate **encrypted traffic patterns** (TLS 1.3, QUIC).  
- Publish **synthetic datasets** with controlled network degradation for benchmarking.  

---

## 3. Real-Time Optimization
- Explore **TinyML approaches** for ultra-low power mobile deployment.  
- Quantize models to **INT8 / INT4 precision** without significant loss in accuracy.  
- Study **energy-efficient inference** for UE devices to balance QoS and battery usage.  

---

## 4. Robustness Improvements
- Develop **adversarially trained models** to withstand traffic obfuscation or mimicry attacks.  
- Incorporate **self-supervised pretraining** on large unlabeled traffic datasets to improve generalization.  
- Use **active learning pipelines** where uncertain UE predictions are flagged and annotated for retraining.  

---

## 5. End-to-End Integration
- Collaborate with **telecom operators** to test deployment on real 4G/5G network slices.  
- Extend integration with **QoE management systems** to optimize user experience dynamically (adaptive bitrate, caching, prefetching).  
- Explore **multi-tier deployment** (UE â†’ Edge â†’ Cloud) for hierarchical inference.  

---

## 6. Monitoring & Feedback Loops
- Introduce **continuous evaluation pipelines** with automated drift detection.  
- Use **federated learning** for privacy-preserving model updates across multiple devices.  
- Integrate with **MLOps frameworks** (Kubeflow, MLflow, W&B) for streamlined retraining.  

---

## 7. Broader Research Directions
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Develop interpretable models to explain why a flow was tagged as video/non-video.  
- **QoE-aware Classification:** Instead of binary classification, predict impact on user experience (stalling, buffering).  
- **Cross-Domain Generalization:** Ensure models trained on one regionâ€™s traffic generalize well across geographies and ISPs.  

---

## 8. Long-Term Vision
The long-term goal is to build a **generalized, robust, and adaptive traffic classification system** that can:  
1. Work across applications and network types.  
2. Self-adapt to evolving encryption and codecs.  
3. Provide **QoS/QoE optimization** seamlessly at the UE, edge, and network levels.  
4. Contribute open datasets and models to the research community for reproducibility.
