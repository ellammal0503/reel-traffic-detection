# Reel Traffic vs Non-Reel Traffic Detection

This project provides a real-time AI model that classifies **video traffic (reels/shorts)** vs **non-video traffic (feeds/suggestions)** in a social networking application.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Real-time inference on packet metadata (no payload inspection).
- Works under varying network conditions (congestion, latency, packet loss).
- Lightweight for mobile devices (low CPU & RAM).

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Structure
- `docs/` â†’ All technical documentation in Markdown.
- `src/` â†’ Source code for training + real-time inference.
- `models/` â†’ Hugging Face model links or trained weights.
- `datasets/` â†’ Datasets used/published.
- `requirements.txt` â†’ Python dependencies.
- `setup.py` â†’ Package installer.

## ðŸš€ Quickstart
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train baseline model
python src/models/train.py --data sample_packets.csv

# Run real-time detector (demo)
python src/app/demo_service.py --pcap sample.pcap
